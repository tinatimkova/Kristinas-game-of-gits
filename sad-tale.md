House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark ended up on the Iron Throne. He united all kingdoms and lived happy and peaceful life ever after.

Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to begin, and let me assure you he will DEFINITELY NOT DIE!


In an ironic twist of fate, Joffery Baratheon tripped over the Iron Throne, landing on his head and dying.


HOWEVER ....
The immortal gorilla from Joe's story actually catches Joffery, saving him, and they all live happily ever after.
